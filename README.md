# üìÑ ENHANCING WATCHER NOTIFICATION EFFICIENCY THROUGH ACCELERATED GRAPH TRAVERSAL

## üìù Abstract
This research presents an advanced approach to optimizing the ETCD watcher notification mechanism by implementing accelerated graph traversal algorithms. Specifically, the study introduces enhanced Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithms developed in Go, aimed at improving real-time data processing within distributed systems. The optimized watcher mechanism reduces latency and resource consumption, enabling faster and more efficient event propagation in ETCD clusters. Experimental analyses were conducted across various ETCD cluster configurations, demonstrating significant performance improvements in terms of notification latency, CPU usage, and scalability.
